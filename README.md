# Docker ELK stack

Based on the official Docker images:

* [elasticsearch](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-docker)
* [logstash](https://github.com/elastic/logstash-docker)
* [kibana](https://github.com/elastic/kibana-docker)

Bring a single ElasticSearch node up, with an instance of Logstash and Kibana via docker-compose.

## Requirements

### Host setup

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download) version **1.10.0+**
2. Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) version **1.6.0+**
3. Clone this repository [Git Clone](https://github.com/chowden/docker-elk.git)


## Usage

### Bringing up the stack

**Note**: In case you switched branch or updated a base image - you may need to run `docker-compose build` first

Change into the docker-elk directory that's been created and then start the ELK stack using `docker-compose`:

```console
$ docker-compose up
```

To run this stack in the background (detached mode - my personal preference):

```console
$ docker-compose up -d
```

Kibana is exposed on localhost, port 5601. [http://localhost:5601](http://localhost:5601) 

By default, the stack exposes the following ports:
* 5000: Logstash TCP input.
* 9200: Elasticsearch HTTP
* 9300: Elasticsearch TCP transport
* 5601: Kibana

Now that the stack is running, you will want to inject some log entries. The shipped Logstash configuration allows you
to send content via TCP:

```console
$ nc localhost 5000 < /path/to/logfile.log
```

## Initial setup

### Default Kibana index pattern creation

When Kibana launches for the first time, it is not configured with any index pattern.

#### Via the Kibana web UI

**NOTE**: You need to inject data into Logstash before being able to configure a Logstash index pattern via the Kibana web
UI. Then all you have to do is hit the *Create* button.

Refer to [Connect Kibana with
Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/connect-to-elasticsearch.html) for detailed instructions
about the index pattern configuration.

#### On the command line

Create an index pattern via the Kibana API:

```console
$ curl -XPOST -D- 'http://localhost:5601/api/saved_objects/index-pattern' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'kbn-version: 6.1.0' \
    -d '{"attributes":{"title":"logstash-*","timeFieldName":"@timestamp"}}'
```

The created pattern will automatically be marked as the default index pattern as soon as the Kibana UI is opened for the first time.

## Configuration

**NOTE**: Configuration is not dynamically reloaded, you will need to restart the stack after any change in the
configuration of a component.

### How can I tune the Kibana configuration?

Kibana is configured inside the docker-compose file with two read-only files, the first one is the one you care about:

    volumes:
      - ./logstash/config/logstash.yml:/usr/share/logstash/config/logstash.yml:ro
      - ./logstash/pipeline:/usr/share/logstash/pipeline:ro

So best to save your changes offline and bring the stack back up.

### How can I tune the Logstash configuration?

The Logstash configuration is stored in `logstash/config/logstash.yml` and is similarly mapped as RO.

    volumes:
      - ./logstash/config/logstash.yml:/usr/share/logstash/config/logstash.yml:ro
      - ./logstash/pipeline:/usr/share/logstash/pipeline:ro

So best to save your changes offline and bring the stack back up.

It is also possible to map the entire `config` directory instead of a single file, however you must be aware that
Logstash will be expecting a
[`log4j2.properties`](https://github.com/elastic/logstash-docker/tree/master/build/logstash/config) file for its own
logging.

### How can I tune the Elasticsearch configuration?

The Elasticsearch configuration is stored in `elasticsearch/config/elasticsearch.yml` and is mapped as RO - so any changes you make while docker cluster is up will not persist.

    volumes:
      - ./elasticsearch/config/elasticsearch.yml:/usr/share/elasticsearch/config/elasticsearch.yml:ro

### How can I scale out the Elasticsearch cluster?

Follow these useful instructions - it's a to-do or a fork of this build [Scaling out
Elasticsearch](https://github.com/deviantony/docker-elk/wiki/Elasticsearch-cluster)

## Storage

### ElasticSearch Data Persistence

The data stored in Elasticsearch will be persisted after container reboot on this configuration.

Inside the docker-compose.yml:

    volumes:
      - ~/docker/elasticsearch/data:/usr/share/elasticsearch/data:rw

This will store Elasticsearch data inside your home directoy under /docker/elasticsearch/data'

**NOTE:** beware of these OS-specific considerations:
* **Linux:** the [unprivileged `elasticsearch` user][esuser] is used within the Elasticsearch image, therefore the
  mounted data directory must be owned by the uid `1000`.
* **macOS:** the default Docker for Mac configuration allows mounting files from `/Users/`, `/Volumes/`, `/private/`,
  and `/tmp` exclusively. Follow the instructions from the [documentation][macmounts] to add more locations.

## Extensibility

### Plugins

To add plugins to any ELK component you have to:

1. Add a `RUN` statement to the corresponding `Dockerfile` (eg. `RUN logstash-plugin install logstash-filter-json`)
2. Add the associated plugin code configuration to the service configuration (eg. Logstash input/output)
3. Rebuild the images using the `docker-compose build` command

### How can I enable the provided extensions?

A few extensions are available inside the [`extensions`](extensions) directory. These extensions provide features which
are not part of the standard Elastic stack, but can be used to enrich it with extra integrations.

The documentation for these extensions is provided inside each individual subdirectory, on a per-extension basis. Some
of them require manual changes to the default ELK configuration.

## JVM tuning

Logstash and Elastic are configured with 256Mb:

    environment:
      LS_JAVA_OPTS: "-Xmx256m -Xms256m"
